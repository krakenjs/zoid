# Security Policy
## How is Zoid secure?
Zoid uses [Post Robot](https://github.com/krakenjs/post-robot) to do [post messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) between multiple domains.
Zoid helps secure messaging through iframe sandboxing, domain validation, and data protection.
- __Iframe sandboxing__ is a default browser feature that blocks others from accessing the data of your iframe instance. 
- __Domain Validation__ checks the domain of the connection made to the Zoid child component, if requested. If domains donâ€™t match accepted domains the connect fails. This is to stop access to secure components.
- __Data Protection__ is the way Zoid manages checking domains of where the data was sent from to help protect against malicious data being injected through events.

## Things Zoid does NOT protect against
- __Clickjacking__ cannot be avoided. Even though the data is secure, the click is happening outside the scope of Zoid, therefore, Zoid cannot validate those actions. To learn more about __clickjacking__ read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking).
